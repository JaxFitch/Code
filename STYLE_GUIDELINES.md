1. **File Naming Conventions**:
   
    * All files should be named using lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens (-) only.
    * Avoid using special characters (e.g. underscores, periods, etc.) in file names.
    * Use descriptive names that accurately reflect the content of the file.
      
2. **Code Formatting**:
   
    * Use consistent indentation (4 spaces).
    * Follow the standard coding conventions for the language used in the repository.
    * Avoid long line of code with excess characters.
    * Use spaces around operators and after commas.
    * Variable names should be camel cased (e.g. variableName).
    * Functions names should also be camel cased (e.g. functionName).
    * Use blank lines to separate code blocks.
